# Generating and Solving Complex Transfer Type Arithmetic Word Problems: An Ontological Approach

This page includes the content related to the work "Generating and Solving Complex Transfer Type Arithmetic Word Problems: An Ontological Approach". In the following, we provide an explanation of the important artifacts/data uploaded to this page. These artifacts/data will help understand the proposed work.
1. The "complex TC word problems" dataset consists of a sample of 80 complex word problems generated by the proposed approach.
2. The "TC-sentence.csv" dataset consists of 500 sentences. These sentences are extracted from the various TC word problems and there are four type of labels representing four differente classes: Before-Transfer (BT), Transfer (TR), After-Transfer (AT), and Question (QS) types of sentences.
